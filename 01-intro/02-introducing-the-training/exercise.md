## The Format

This training is different from most online courses.
It's completely hands-on, with just the amount of theory needed.
You progress through modules by solving exercises.

Each exercise has tests that verify your solution.
For some exercises, you can see the test code to understand what's expected.
But for most, the tests run behind the scenes.

There are two types of exercises:

* **Regular** — small code snippets that teach one specific concept.
* **Project** — where you apply what you learned to a larger codebase.

You'll build the project throughout the entire training.
It will give a good overview of what a production-like codebase looks like.

## How to go through the training

If you can read this, you already have our `tdl` CLI installed.
There's only one command you need to run from now on to go to the next exercise:

```bash
tdl training run
```

Running it will verify your solution, and will let you proceed to the next exercise.

### Structure

You can read the exercise description and theory on this website.

In your local environment, you will find the exercise files you're going to change.
They will be sorted across directories with the module number and name.
It's the same structure as you can see in the sidebar on the right side of this page.

The long-running project you're going to work on will stay in the `project` directory.
(No matter which module you're in.)

Next to the exercise files, you'll also find a markdown file with the exercise description.
It's the same content as on the website, but you can read it in your editor.
We still recommend using the website for the best experience.

We recommend keeping your entire project directory in a git repository.
It's the best way to pick up the training on another computer.

## Getting Stuck

**This training recreates real-world learning — you build a complete project and grasp advanced concepts over time.**

We don't explain every detail in depth (that's what books are for).
Instead, you learn by doing.

**Getting stuck is normal. It's how you learn.**
When it happens, don't give up too quickly — that's where the real learning happens.

We have a couple of ways to help you move on.

### Example solutions

**If you get stuck, you can view an example solution on the exercise page.
Solutions also unlock after you complete each exercise.**

Remember: these examples are just one way to solve the problem.
Your solution might look different, and that's fine!

### AI Mentor

**At the bottom of this page, you'll find our AI Mentor.**

Unlike most chatbots, it sees your code and can help you find the solution.

You can also ask it follow-up questions about the exercise or ask for a diagram to better understand what's missing.

### Getting Help

**Join our Discord community to get help from other developers and the authors. Click the Discord button at the top of this page.**

The community is a key part of the training.
You'll have access to private channels for each module where you can discuss solutions, ask for reviews, or get help when you're stuck.

## It's time to code!
